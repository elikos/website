            "content": "During the 2016 edition of the IARC, Elikos attempted to fly autonomously, interact with ground robots, and avoid obstacles. For localisation, our own visual-inertial localisation algorith was fused with the on-board optical flow sensor. Target and obstacle robot detection was also improved. Finally, a decision-making module was developed in order to make optimal decisions according to the position of the drone and ground robots.",
